Key integration modes described by DeoVR

1) Single video deeplink (one JSON per video)
- A JSON file describes a single video.
- The app is typically launched via a deeplink of the form:
  deovr://https://your-host/path/to/video.json

Important fields (as used by DeoVR examples)
- title (string)
- id (number; use it to distinguish same-title items)
- is3d (boolean; docs emphasize this should be true)
- screenType (string): commonly "sphere" (360) or "dome" (180)
- stereoMode (string): "sbs", "tb", "cuv", or "off"
- videoLength (number, seconds)
- encodings (array): each encoding contains:
  - name (string)
  - videoSources (array) with items like:
    - resolution (number)
    - url (string)

Optional preview/thumbnail fields
- thumbnailUrl (image URL) is required when the video is presented in a Selection Scene list.
- videoPreview / videoThumbnail exist in docs for preview/seek-lookup use cases.

2) Multiple videos selection (Selection Scene)
- A single JSON file returns a list of scenes, each containing a list of videos.

Two formats are described:
- Full format: each list entry embeds the full single-video JSON fields.
- Shortened format (recommended for large lists): each list entry only includes:
  - title (string)
  - videoLength (number, seconds)
  - thumbnailUrl (string URL)
  - video_url (string URL to the full per-video JSON)

Authorization note
- Docs describe using POST for list/video JSON when authorization is used, and an "authorized" field:
  - 1 = authorized
  - 0 = guest/no account
  - -1 = auth error

How MediaViewer maps to this
- /deovr: serves a Selection Scene JSON using the shortened format fields (title, videoLength, thumbnailUrl, video_url).
- /deovr/video/:id: serves the per-video JSON with encodings/videoSources and fields like screenType/stereoMode.
- MediaViewer also supports an optional sessionId query parameter to help coordinate sync with desktop clients.
